## Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for the modified EEZYbotARM Mk2 robotic arm, designed to enhance its reach and functionality. The project integrates both hardware and software components, providing a versatile and user-friendly robotic arm solution.

## Features

1. **Extended Reach:** The EEZYbotARM Mk2 has been modified to extend its reach, allowing it to access a wider range of positions and objects.

2. **Suction Cup Attachment:** A suction cup attachment has been added to the robotic arm, enabling it to grip and manipulate objects with various shapes and sizes.

3. **Python GUI Control:** A Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to control the robotic arm. The GUI provides an intuitive way to interact with the arm, making it accessible to users with various levels of expertise.

4. **Arduino Inverse Kinematics:** The Arduino-based inverse kinematics code has been implemented to calculate the necessary joint angles for achieving desired end-effector positions. This ensures precise and accurate control of the robotic arm.

## Repository Contents

- **Arduino Code:** Contains the Arduino sketch for controlling the robotic arm's movements using inverse kinematics.

- **Python GUI:** Includes the Python code for the graphical user interface used to control the arm. This GUI offers features such as manual control, pre-defined motions, and object manipulation using the suction cup.

- **Hardware Designs:** Provides documentation and files related to the modified hardware components, including 3D-printable parts and assembly instructions.

- **Documentation:** Contains user guides, tutorials, and technical documentation to assist users in setting up and using the modified EEZYbotARM Mk2.
